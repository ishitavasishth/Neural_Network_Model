# ðŸ§  Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective approach to recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Built entirely in Google Colab using TensorFlow and Keras â€” **no API keys or external dependencies required**.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside

- Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset
- Visualize sample handwritten digits
- Build a fully connected neural network (Dense layers)
- Train and evaluate the model
- Plot accuracy over epochs
- Generate predictions and visualize results
- Confusion matrix and classification report
- Test with custom uploaded images (your own digits!)

## ðŸ§ª Try It Yourself
Upload your own image of a handwritten digit (preferably white digit on black background) and the model will predict it! The image is preprocessed, resized to 28x28 pixels, normalized, and then passed to the trained model.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab
